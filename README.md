## Assignment 7 - Data Analytics Lab

### Name: Harika 
### Roll Number: DA25C024 

#### Documentation: 
##### This assignment, based on the Landsat Satellite Dataset, challenges the traditional use of Accuracy for model selection in a multi-class environment. The primary goal is to perform a rigorous model comparison and selection process by utilizing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision-Recall Curves (PRC), adapted for multi-class classification using the One-vs-Rest (OvR) approach. The analysis focuses on performance across different decision thresholds and the inherent trade-offs between classifier type

#### Key tasks completed in this assignment:
    - Evaluating data using 6 models - KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Dummy Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes 
    - Implemented ROC-AUC and PRC-AP cruves 
    - Analyzed all the results

### Folder Structure
- `Assignment_7.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with all solutions
- `sat.trn` -> file of the training dataset
- `sat.tst` -> file of the testing dataset
- `README.md` → documentation of the submission  

##### Just need to run Assignment_7.ipynb file keeping the downloaded dataset intact.
